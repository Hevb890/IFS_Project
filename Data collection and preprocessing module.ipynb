But only qty 0.3 has been invoiced. The remaining qty 0.7 is not invoiced.The requirement is to Undo Delivery 0.7 which is not yet invoiced. But the system does not allow to do this through Undo Customer Order Delivery due to the following error.Is there another way to accomplish this?Thanks in Advance!!\n",

      "Hello IFS community,I have a question regarding how the Lot Size Based Product Structure works.Here is a short summary of what I tested:Product Structure  - Lot Size Structure – Anything bigger than 23 pcs should have Alternate “1” and anything smaller should use alternate “*”.I then master scheduled 35 pcs of this part number in one day. My Planning details for lot sizing are set as follows: Max lot size set to 25 pcs (no min or Std).Result – Two Shop Order requisitions: 1 with 10 lot size and one with 25 lot size but BOTH with alternate 1 (only for lots bigger than 23).EXPECTED result: Two Shop Order Reqs: 1 with 10 and one with 25 but with different PRODUCT ALTERNATES.In this case, we are trying to tell IFS to use a different packaging for when we make 25 pcs Lot size.I read in the link below that only MRP checks through Lot Size Based Product Structure:Selecting Product Structure Alternate while performing MRP/MS in App-9 | IFS CommunityIs this true or am I facing a bug? And if it is true, what could possibly be the reason why when I set all the lot sizing rules (structure and planning) that I would not be able to use such a feature!?Why wouldn't MS also check through such configs?I hope I can understand this better with your help.

      "Hi,We use transport tasks to move reserved stock from the warehouse to the pre-production floor.In our process, we reserve everything, for example all 10 needed units. But due to logistic issues, we cannot move all units at once. So we need to execute the tranport task in pieces.We use WaDaCo.We currently cannot do it in pieces in IFS. If we enter a lower quantity than assigned on the TT in WaDaCo, we get the error message “When moving reserved stock, the quantity on the the transport task line must equal the reserved quantity on the reservation, which is XX”Problem here is that we need to manually follow up what’s the status of the transport task, as we or need to confirm it all in the beginning, or at the end. During the real life executing, IFS is not alligned with the real life situation.Is there a solution for this, somewhere a setting perhaps?

      "Content:\n",
      "Hi all,We are having some issues with part revisions and I can’t figure out the best way to tackle them. A little background on how we are using the software first (We are on IFS Cloud 22r2):We are using the engineering part navigator to build out the components that an assembly is comprised of. Once the assembly is complete, we use theEngineering Revision Transfer Actionspage to transfer the assembly and its components. We use the ‘all level transfer’ so the entire product structure is transferred, including any new parts that were created for that assembly.We also haveRemote Warehouse Assortmentssetup for service vans so they can be replenished with items when necessary. The items are moved from our main warehouse to the remote warehouses via a transport task which is automatically created because the remote warehouses are setup with theAutomatically Refill Putaway Zonesoption.The all-level part transfer causes an issue with part revisions for items that already existed in inventory. Any part that existed in inventory prior to the transfer gets revision 2. Since there is a new revision, a transport task is automatically created to move stock to putaway zones that already have the item filled under revision 1. I believe it’s because the system is readying qty (0) of revision 2, so it wants to move the appropriate quantity of the new revision.So that leaves me with the big question:Is there any way to update the revision of inventory parts in stock so the transport tasks don’t try to move twice as much as they should be?Or perhaps there is a more elegant solution?I appreciate and welcome any suggestions and help.Dylan\n",

      "Our business is on v10 IEE, and we have lot and serial tracked parts. We are trying to configure weekly cycle count reports that include a specified number of parts to count and ALL lots / serials of those parts on each report. We are combining the Include Full Qty Of Part In Location parameter option with the Number of records to be Printed option.The hope was that, upon specifying a Number of Records, for example 15, the resulting count report includes 15 different part numbers, and all of the different lots/serials for those – which could be well over 15 lines to count on the report depending on the number of lots/serials in stock for those 15 parts. In actuality, we have found the Number of Records parameter restricts the number of lines on the report, not number of parts – for example, the resulting report may contain 10 different lots of Part A, and 5 different lots of Part B; we end up performing a full count of two part numbers only, when the intent is to include many more part numbers.Has anyone faced this challenge, and discovered a solution or workaround to achieve the desired result?

      "Hi Community.We work in the Aviation industry, and often we use External Service Orders, (ESO) to send parts from stock to a repair station to get them repaired and then returned for us to fit back onto aitcraft.Often we send parts out that may come back with a modification carried out that changes their part number slightly, and therefore changes the fit/form/function of the part. For example, a part 101-11 may be sent out, then returned as a 101-15. It will often keep it serial number if serial tracked.Currently we use the Alternate Parts functionality to register 101-15 as an alternate for a 101-11, then we use the “Change Receipt Conditions” to change this to receipt in the correct part from the supplier,  however due to the modification, this is not truly accurate, as the modified part (101-15) may not have the same characteristics, or uses as the original part (101-11).The only alternative we have considered is receipting in the original part, 101-11, then performing a part no, serial rename, and changing the part upon receipt, however we then have the issue that the receipted part in the system was technically not correct, as we did not receipt a 101-11, we received a 101-15, and the paperwork that comes with the part reflects this.Has anyone seen this or have any ideas on what we might be able to do, we understand that this is very common in the A&D space, therefore IFS must have a solution somehow.Many thanks for your assistance.David.\n",

      "Hi all,Wondering if anyone has dealt with unreceiving a part in IFS. Specifically, let’s say there is the following scenario:Receiver in warehouse receives items on PO 12345. After completing receiving, it is discovered that something is wrong with part/they over received/or something else causing the need to “Unreceive” parts.Does anyone have this function turned on in IFS and if so, do you have some pros & cons and best practices on dealing with these situations?Any information on what potential implications could arise from unreceiving - first thought is Finance with invoicing, etc.Thank you,StephiconBest answer byShawnBerk22 July 2022, 04:41View original\n",

      "Hi,We’re stumbling upon an issue where the benefit we see in using Handling Units is not in reach.The use case is that we manufacture many small parts on different Shop Orders, these parts are engineered-to-order and therefore manufactured via DOP and automatically Pegged to the Top Level in the DOP Header. This results in automatically Reserved Qty as of Shop Order Receipt of these small parts.The issue we’re facing is that these parts can be up towards 100 different part numbers which we then want to attach to a Handling Unit for efficient inventory movement, but this is not possible without unreserving these parts.Neither is it possible to connect the same Handling Unit to multiple different Shop Orders, to receive them onto the connected Handling Unit.Any proposals on how to solve this issue, preferably with core functionality or configurations are highly appreciated.Thanks,Alexander\n",

We have created the following Delivery Route for this:IFS > Delivery RouteThis Route was attached to all internal customers on the address level. When creating a CO the route is automatically filled in the Order Details. When adding a CO Line, the Planned Ship/Date should change according to the Wanted Delivery Date and pick the departure in the morning or in the afternoon. The Planned Delivery Period should then fetch this information in order to display a period linked to the assigned calendar (Site or Customer level).The problem is that the Planned Ship/Date always picks the departure route in the morning.Has anyone worked with multiple deliveries per day yet in the Delivery Route?

      "Hi All,I have a customer that is focussing more and more on his Supply Chain planning and looking at the IPAP details. Now they have parts that use Condition Codes (NEW/DAMAGED/REPAIRED). The repairs are done externally by their supplier and this is handled through the External Service orders.Now, the external repair process creates a CO to send the damaged parts to their supplier and a corresponding Po to receive the repaired parts back. In the IPAP we see these PO’s with repaired parts.Now comes the crux: the company has an internal decision that the repaired parts are only to be used in the Service Department, not in Production. So they actually don’t want to see the incoming Po’s of repaired items because this throws their supply chain for production a bit off.So actually, they would like to exclude parts based on condition code from the IPAP overview. But i don’t see any possibilities on this in the standard IFS solution. Would anybody have any additional tips on this?Some workarounds I found myself:Put the External Repair Po’s on ‘Stopped’ using ‘Status’ > ‘Freeze’ - this removes the PO from the IPAP (disadvantage = we need to release again before regsuering arrival)Putting the Safety Stock on such a QTY that the limited amount of Repairs does not have a major impact on production (is not a very structured solution)Looking forward to any tips this community might have!best RegardsRoel\n",
